# Advent of code solutions 2022..

This is a repository with solutions to the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com), I commenced in 2023 for the 2022 event.

The solutions are for 2022, hopefully I'll get round to looking at them all. My solutions are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

There are more experienced Rust developers out there who will have more concise solutions than the ones here.
